### Static web apps
Static web apps in Microsoft Azure allow developers to quickly create and deploy high-performance, serverless web applications. By leveraging the power of serverless computing, developers can focus on building and maintaining their applications without having to worry about maintaining the underlying infrastructure. Static web apps also enable developers to quickly build and deploy modern web applications with next-generation features such as custom domains, authentication, and automated deployments. Additionally, developers can take advantage of the scalability, reliability, and security of Microsoft Azure to power their applications.
### Health bot

Health Bot can help answer questions about health topics, provide self-care guidance, and connect customers to the right provider. The bot can also collect patient data and triage cases.
